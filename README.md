Simple discord bot for automatic stream pings. 1 request is sent every 2 seconds, and streams usually get sent within 20-40 seconds of a stream starting.

Use /add (username) to add a streamer to the list. Make sure it is the exact username of the streamer you want to add. Additionally, you may specify the streamers Twitch ID (usually wont be needed as the username is automatically converted to their Twitch ID, but just in case). 

/view to view the list of streamers you have added. /remove (index) to remove a streamer. If "Caseoh" is in number 2 on the list, using /remove 2 will remove Caseoh.
